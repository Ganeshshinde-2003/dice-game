<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>The game is played in turns. On each turn, a player rolls two dice and adds the numbers together. The total is then added to the player's score.

If a player rolls a 1 on either dice, their turn is over and their score for that turn is reset to 0. Otherwise, they can choose to "Hold" their score at any time, which adds their current score to their total score and passes the dice to the other player.

The first player to reach the target score of 100 wins the game.</p>

<h2>Responsiveness</h2>
<p>The Dice Game is designed to be responsive and should adapt to different screen sizes and devices. The game uses CSS media queries to adjust the layout and styles based on the width of the viewport.

In addition, the game is designed to be playable on both desktop and mobile devices. The controls are large and easy to tap on touch screens.</p>
